# THE PULSE, ONE RUN: sync the library to its pin, print the scorecard, append
# the day's totals to history.csv, render every subject's bands (step 1, with
# the library's per-band sheet, step 5) and write the page (step 2, out/<date>/site/).
#
#   ./run.sh                 one run, into out/<date>/
#   ./run.sh --bump          first move the pin to the library's main
#   ./run.sh --no-render     the scorecard and the row only
#   PULSE_CAP_S=1800         the per-subject time cap for the renders
#   PULSE_BACKLOG=0          skip the derivation backlog (tools/backlog.sh, on by default)
#   PULSE_DERIVE=none        drawn today only: no derived column
#   PULSE_ONLY="a/b c/d"     render only these subjects (a manual look)
#   PULSE_BAKE=0             skip the bake and the catalog (tools/bake.sh, tools/catalog.py)
#   PULSE_TRANSFER=0         bake without the baked channel (fast, structural only)
#   PULSE_RESUME=1           resume an interrupted run: a subject whose sheet and
#                            close-up are already in out/<date>/ from the SAME
#                            library pin is not rendered again (a container
#                            restart or a time limit costs minutes, not hours);
#                            off by default, so a daily run always renders fresh
#
# Rules (fable-plans/active/the-pulse-is-a-consumer, in the library):
#   - every number comes from the library's scorecard tool, every frame from the
#     library's sheet and close-up tools; this script decides nothing about
#     scoring or rendering;
#   - nothing generated is committed here but history.csv, one dated row per run;
#     the derivation backlog's records go to the library (tools/backlog.sh);
#   - a failed run writes a row that says so, never nothing.
