# THE CATALOG'S BAKE: every rung's glTF and the impostor atlases, made by the
# explorer's own tool exactly as its refresh.sh made them, against the pinned
# library.
#
#   tools/bake.sh                 impostor atlases, then the registry bake with --transfer
#   PULSE_TRANSFER=0 tools/bake.sh   the structural bake only (fast; no baked channel)
#   PULSE_RESUME=1 tools/bake.sh     finish a bake cut short (a session's time limit,
#                                    a restart): the atlases are not made again and
#                                    each subject already baked is skipped, kept in
#                                    out/bake-resume/<library>-<explorer>-<mode>/;
#                                    another pin or mode starts fresh
#
# The order is refresh.sh's and it is not arbitrary: `tools/impostor.sh` must run
# before the bake, because the bake only names an atlas already on disk
# (asset-generators defects/017, 018). Both write only the library's
# gitignored build/artifacts/; the library's source tree is never touched, and
# `tools/sync-library.sh --verify` still holds after this.
