#   EDGE_ZONE             the owner's domain: the intake's public URL and pulse.<zone>
#   CATALOG_PUBLIC_BASE   the catalog bucket's public URL, ending in /
#   ITCH_URL              optional: the finer builds' itch page, which does not
#                         exist until stage 1 (the pages read "free at 1080;
#                         finer builds soon" without it)
# Until every required one is set it stops before deploying anything, names what is
# missing and exits 3: those values are the owner's to give (2026-10-03), and
# this step never works around them. The catalog's hostname is the one the
# explorer's Pages config names (explorer/wrangler.toml, `# hostname:`).
#
# With them, it refuses before uploading when no Access application covers
# pulse.<zone> (the pulse is private or it is not published: the plan's step 3
# ablation) or when the catalog's request form still points at a local URL.
